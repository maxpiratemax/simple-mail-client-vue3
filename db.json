      "body": "Hello!\n\n How is it going so far?\n\nIf you‚Äôre completely new to programming, even simple puzzles will be challenging. I suggest learning the basics of programming first, like String manipulation, arrays, conditionals and loops.\n\n  Here's a couple of hints to help you get started ü§ó\n\n All the puzzles here work the same. You‚Äôre given a problem, and the skeleton of a program to solve it. The skeleton reads the inputs from the server and gives back a default (but incorrect) output.\n\n Just modify the code and output the correct answer for every possible case.\n\n Easy, right? üí™\n\n You might need some time to get accustomed to things here, but you‚Äôll be able to tackle harder problems soon, like the one Mathis solved with dynamic programming on our YouTube channel.\n\n Cheers,\n\n The Codingame Team",
